# New-York-Taxi-Fare-Prediction
Kaggle challenge : https://www.kaggle.com/c/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction

Task Summary:
In this playground competition, hosted in partnership with Google Cloud and Coursera, you are tasked with predicting the fare amount (inclusive of tolls) for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. While you can get a basic estimate based on just the distance between the two points, this will result in an RMSE of $5-$8, depending on the model used (see the starter code for an example of this approach in Kernels). Your challenge is to do better than this using Machine Learning techniques!

Results:
I (https://www.kaggle.com/gakaushik) was ranked in top 50% in this Kaggle competition to predict the fare amount for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations. Performed data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering and visualization. Evaluated linear regression, random forest regressor and LightWeight GBM models and picked the one that gave least root mean square error on dataset.
